    "text": "Where should the next new business outlet be located in order to optimise the profit? What are the location factors that affect the resale prices of HDB housing units? Which are the economic or service activities such as IT professional firms, car workshops, fast food chains (ie. KFC, McDonalds), coffee outlets (Starbucks, Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Toast Box) that tend to be located close to one another and which are the ones that tend to be a distance apart? Do these observed patterns and processes occur at random or are they being constrained by geographical factors? These and many other related questions are the challenges faced by data scientists and data analysts today especially when geographical data are used.\nGeospatial Analytics offers the solutions to these questions by providing data scientists and analysts a problem-driven and data-centric analysis framework focusing on discovering actionable understanding from geographically referenced data. It makes extensive use of geospatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, spatial statistical, geospatial machine learning and spatial data visualisation techniques to support decision- and strategy-making.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to the concepts, principles and methods of geospatial analytics and their practical applications of geospatial analytics in real world operations. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nperforming geospatial data science tasks such as importing, tidying, manipulating, transforming, projecting and processing geospatial data programmatically,\nvisualising, analysing and describing geographical patterns and processes using appropriate geovisualisation and thematic mapping techniques,\nconducting geospatial analysis by using appropriate spatial statistics and Geomachine learning methods and\ncommunicating the geospatial analysis pipeline in a reproducible report."

    "text": "Grading Summary\n\n\n\nAssignments / Assessment categories\nWeighting\n\n\n\n\nClass participation (including pre-lesson learning)\n25%\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (5% x 5)\n25%\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (25% x 2)\n50%\n\n\n\n\nClass Participation (25%)\nPre-lesson videos and recommended readings exercises will be released one week before the weekly lesson starts. A strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and video before coming to class. Students are required write down at least one question or issue encountered while viewing the video or reading the recommended articles and raised them during the in-class discussion.\nStudent sharing of insights from readings of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course. Students may also be quizzed in class and thereby contribute to class participation.\n\n\nHands-on Exercise (25%)\nHands-on exercises aim to provide students to gain hands-on experience on using selected R packages to perform geospatial analysis with real world use cases. It is important for students to complete the hands-on exercises before class. This is because the in-class discussion will extend the methods learned from the hands-on exercise to advanced modelling. The in-class discussion will also focus on how to interpret the analysis results and to communicate the analysis results by using appropriate map and data visualisation techniques.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise (50%)\nThere are two take-home exercises that are due throughout the term. They aim to provide students the opportunities to apply the methods learned in class by working through mini real-world cases. Each take-home exercise is an extension of the hands-on and in-class exercises. What this means is that, for example, in Lesson 1, students will learn the concept of spatial point processes and the hands-on exercise will provide students step-by-step guide on how to use R packages to perform spatial point patterns analysis. The in-class discussion, beside clarification of the concepts and usage of R packages syntax and argument, it will focus more on how to interpret and communicate the analysis results. Then the take-home exercise will require students to synthesise what they have learned from the readings, hands-on exercise and in-class exercise. The estimated workload will be about 6-8 hours per week.\nEach take-home exercise will carry a same weightage of 25%. The deliverable format of the take-home exercises and marking rubric of will be provided on the handout of the take-home exercise. Feedback on take-home exercise will be provided weekly before the weekly lesson starts. This is to ensure that students will learn from mistakes made in the earlier take-home exercise and improve their work progressively in the subsequent take-home exercises.\nStudents may work together to help one another with computer or geospatial issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s.\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere will be no final examination for this course."

    "section": "Setting the Scene",
    "text": "Setting the Scene\nAs city-wide urban infrastructures such as buses, taxis, mass rapid transit, public utilities and roads become digital, the datasets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS and RFID on the vehicles. For example, routes and ridership data were collected with the use of smart cards and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices available on the public buses. These massive movement data collected are likely to contain structure and patterns that provide useful information about characteristics of the measured phenomena. The identification, analysis and comparison of such patterns will provide greater insights on human movement and behaviours within a city. These understandings will potentially contribute to a better urban management and useful information for urban transport services providers both from the private and public sector to formulate informed decision to gain competitive advantage.\nIn real-world practices, the use of these massive locational aware data, however, tend to be confined to simple tracking and mapping with GIS applications. This is mainly due to a general lack of functions in conventional GIS which is capable of analysing and model spatial and spatio-temporal data effectively."

    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readr, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\nGeospatial Analysis (25 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate thematic and analytics mapping techniques and R functions introduced in class to analysis the geospatial data prepared. You will be assessed on your ability to derive analytical maps by using appropriate rate mapping techniques.\nGeovisualisation and Geocommunication (25 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the complex spatial statistics results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (20 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of Markdown. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (10 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature."
