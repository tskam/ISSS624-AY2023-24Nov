## Setting the Scene

What are the driving forces behind urban dwellers to weak up early in morning to commute from their home locations to their work places? What are the impact of removing a public bus service on the commuters reside along the corridor of the bus route? These and many other questions related to urban mobility are challenges faced by transport operators and urban managers.

To provide answer to this question, traditionally, commuters survey will be used. However, commuters survey is a very costly, time-consuming and laborous, not to mention that the survey data tend to take a long time to clean and analyse. As a result, it is not unusual, by the time the survey report was ready, most of the information already out-of-date!

As city-wide urban infrastructures such as public buses, mass rapid transits, public utilities and roads become digital, the data sets obtained can be used as a framework for tracking movement patterns through space and time. This is particularly true with the recent trend of massive deployment of pervasive computing technologies such as GPS on the vehicles and SMART cards used by public transport commuters.

Unfortunately, this explosive growth of geospatially-referenced data has far outpaced the planner's ability to utilize and transform the data into insightful information thus creating an adverse impact on the return on the investment made to collect and manage this data.

## Motivation and Objective

This take-home exercise is motivated by two main reasons. Firstly, despite increasing amounts of open data available for public consumption, there has not been significant practice research carried out to show how these disparate data sources can be integrated, analysed, and modelled to support policy making decisions.

Secondly, there is a general lack of practical research to show how geospatial data science and analysis (GDSA) can be used to support decision-making.

Hence, your task for this take-home exercise is to conduct a case study to demonstrate the potential value of GDSA to integrate publicly available data from multiple sources for building a spatial interaction models to determine factors affecting urban mobility patterns of public bus transit.

## The Data

### Open Government Data

For the purpose of this assignment, data from several open government sources will be used:

-   *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops*, *Bus Stop Location*, *Train Station* and *Train Station Exit Point*, just to name a few of them, from [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html).

-   *Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary*, *HDB Property Information*, *School Directory and Information* and other relevant data from [Data.gov.sg](https://beta.data.gov.sg/).

### Specially collected data

-   *Business*, *entertn*, *F&B*, *FinServ*, *Leisure&Recreation* and *Retails* are geospatial data sets of the locations of business establishments, entertainments, food and beverage outlets, financial centres, leisure and recreation centres, retail and services stores/outlets I compiled for urban mobility study. They are available on in the geospatial folder to Take-home Exercise 2 data folder.

-   HDB: This data set is the geocoded version of *HDB Property Information* data from data.gov.  The data set is prepared using September 2021 data.  If you want to prepare you own data by using the latest *HDB Property Information* provided on data.gov.sg, this [link](https://is415-msty.netlify.app/posts/2021-10-25-take-home-exercise-3/?panelset6=glimpse%28%29#geocoding-our-aspatial-data) provides a useful step-by-step guide.

These data sets are specially prepared by the course instructor for teaching purposes.  Students are not allowed to the use these data sets beyond ISSS624 without getting permission from the course instructor.

## The Task

The specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:

### Geospatial Data Science

-   Derive an analytical hexagon data of 325m (this distance is the perpendicular distance between the centre of the hexagon and its edges) to represent the [traffic analysis zone (TAZ)](https://tmg.utoronto.ca/files/Reports/Traffic-Zone-Guidance_March-2021_Final.pdf).

-   With reference to the time intervals provided in the table below, construct an O-D matrix of commuter flows for a time interval of your choice by integrating *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops* and *Bus Stop Location* from [LTA DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html). The O-D matrix must be aggregated at the analytics hexagon level

    | Peak hour period             | Bus tap on time |
    |------------------------------|-----------------|
    | Weekday morning peak         | 6am to 9am      |
    | Weekday afternoon peak       | 5pm to 8pm      |
    | Weekend/holiday morning peak | 11am to 2pm     |
    | Weekend/holiday evening peak | 4pm to 7pm      |

-   Display the O-D flows of the passenger trips by using appropriate geovisualisation methods (not more than 5 maps).

-   Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the geovisualisation (not more than 100 words per visual).

-   Assemble at least three propulsive and three attractiveness variables by using aspatial and geospatial from publicly available sources.

-   Compute a distance matrix by using the analytical hexagon data derived earlier.

### Spatial Interaction Modelling

-   Calibrate spatial interactive models to determine factors affecting urban commuting flows at the selected time interval.

-   Present the modelling results by using appropriate geovisualisation and graphical visualisation methods. (Not more than 5 visuals)

-   With reference to the Spatial Interaction Model output tables, maps and data visualisation prepared, describe the modelling results. (not more than 100 words per visual).

## Grading Criteria

This exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:

-   **Geospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks):** This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as tidyverse (readr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).

-   **Geospatial Analysis (25 marks):** In this exercise, you are required to calibrate Spatial Interaction Models introduced in class to determine factors affecting public bus commuter flows. You will be assessed on your ability to apply the methods learned correctly and efficiently.

-   **Geovisualisation and Geocommunication (25 marks):** In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the complex spatial modelling results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.

-   **Reproducibility (20 marks):** This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks in Quarto. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.

-   **Bonus (10 marks):** Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature.
